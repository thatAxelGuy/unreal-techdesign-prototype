# Unreal Engine 5 – Third Person Action Prototype  
*(Udemy Tutorial Project Showcase)*

This repository contains the **C++ source code and configuration** from my work in the  
📚 *Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course (Udemy)*.  

I use GitHub to **showcase code and design work**, while the **full project including assets**  
(animations, materials, large files) is hosted privately on **Azure DevOps**, where I also experimented  
with large file handling and DevOps workflows.

## 🎮 Features Implemented
In this project I extended the base tutorial and built a prototype featuring:

- ✅ **Custom Third Person Character** – animations, movement, attacks  
- 🔄 **Weapon System** – pick up & carry weapons, switch between armed/unarmed states  
- 🪓 **Destructible Objects** – props that react to attacks  
- 🎁 **Loot Pickups** – items that can be collected during play  
- 🤖 **AI Enemies** – full animation set, hit reactions, combat logic  
- 🧭 **AI Pathing** – navigation mesh integration, enemies track & follow the player
